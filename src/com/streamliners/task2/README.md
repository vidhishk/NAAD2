# Assignment / Task 2

## 2.1 getList()
Write a function
`List<Integer> getList(String s)`where :
- String s consists of integers separated by ';'

Your task is to create & return a List<Integer> which will contain all the integers present in string s.

Use String.split() function for this task. Learn [here](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/library/string/split).

Example :

`getList("1;2;3;4") = List<Integer> {1, 2, 3, 4}`

## 2.2 getOccurrencesHashMap()
Write a function
`HashMap<Integer, Integer> getOccurrencesHashMap(String s)`where :
- String s consists of integers separated by ';'

Your task is to create & return a HashMap<Integer, Integer> where :
- Entry.Key represent an integer present in string s
- Entry.Value represent the number of occurrences of that integer in string s

Example : 

`getOccurrencesHashMap("1;2;2;2;3;1") = HashMap<Integer, Integer> {1:2, 2:3, 3:1}`
because 1 occurs 2 times, 2 occurs 3 times and 3 occurs 1 time.

## 2.3 WordGuessGame
In this task you have to develop a game in which user has to guess an incomplete word (consonants omitted) shown. The game should work as follows :

- To start the game, call `startGame(String s)` and pass the word to be guessed.
- Write a function `startGame(String s)` in which,
- replace consonants in s with '_'
- chances = (noOfConsonantsInS + 3)  
- while(chances-- != 0),   
    - print s and take a character as input
    - if character exists in s, update s
    - break if entire word is guessed (User WINS!)
    
User loses if word is not guessed within the chances given.   

Example : startGame("SHAMBHO")
